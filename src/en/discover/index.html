      <p class="mb-0 p">
        Ceph is capable of rapid scaling, without the typical downtime other solutions require. Using the advanced CRUSH algorithm, Ceph
        overcomes all scalability challenges, leading the way towards truly flexible, incredibly resilient storage at scale. Stop relying on
        expensive, vendor-specific hardware and lock-in contracts. Break free of legacy limitations. Grow your storage clusters
        exponentially as your business scales. Ceph is the scalable, cost-effective solution to rapid and unpredictable data growth in the
        enterprise market, academic institutions, and beyond.

      <h3 class="h3">Ceph is reliable</h3>
      <p class="p">
        Data is irreplaceable, so storage system reliability and fine-tuned management is paramount. Achieve peace of mind with Ceph;
        self-managing and self-healing, Ceph finds and rectifies issues before you are even aware of them. Within your storage cluster, Ceph
        Monitor and Manager daemons coordinate to increase reliability and data availability across interconnected systems. The CRUSH
        algorithm mitigates the risk of single points of failure, performance bottlenecks, and limits to scalability, creating a reliable
        and high-performing storage solution, fit for the growing enterprise market.
