## Workflow simplification

For a long time the sharing of multi-TB genomic research data sets with other institutions involved time consuming cataloguing and logistical complexities of shipping physical disks.

Compared to physical disks, managing data flows through Ceph and S3 is significantly easier. The Institute no longer has to spend so many resources worrying about who is responsible for the disks, cataloguing, encryption, or border constraints on data movement – so staff can spend more time focusing on the projects themselves.

## So, where to begin?

Download the “[Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://pages.ubuntu.com/rs/066-EOV-335/images/Wellcome%20Sanger%20Institute%20Case%20Study.pdf)” case study here to discover how Ceph enables efficient sharing of clinical research.
