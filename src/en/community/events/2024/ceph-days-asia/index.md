### Bringing Ceph to OpenInfra Summit Asia

A full-day event dedicated to sharing Ceph’s transformative power and fostering
the vibrant Ceph community co-located at <a href="https://2024.openinfraasia.org/">
OpenInfra Summit Asia</a> in South Korea.

This event is hosted by the Ceph community and Samsung.

The expert Ceph team, Ceph’s customers and partners, and the Ceph community
join forces to discuss things like the status of the Ceph project, recent Ceph
project improvements and roadmap, and Ceph community news. The day ends with
a networking reception, to foster more Ceph learning.

   <td><strong>Is Rook Ceph good for Large Scale S3 storage?</strong>
<p>
In this talk, we will explore Rook, its strengths, and how it compares to Cephadm. 
We'll address the question, "Is Rook a good fit for you?" by examining its deployment in large-scale production environments and its integration with existing clusters.

We will discuss benchmarking and optimizing your Rook cluster for production, along with monitoring and troubleshooting strategies. Additionally, we will look at potential future improvements in Rook Ceph.

This session offers a concise overview of our journey from zero to a fully operational Rook Ceph cluster, sharing key learnings and insights along the way.

   <td><strong>NVMe-oF recovery: Robust Ceph design through disaggregating domains</strong>
<p>
In this talk, we will explore NVMe-oF Recovery, which enables fast recovery through NVMe-oF-based storage disaggregation. In large-scale distributed storage systems, compute node failures are common. These failures may trigger unexpected I/Os to restore system availability. NVMe-oF offers an opportunity to disaggregate compute and storage resources, reducing the impact of such failures. However, Ceph's Converged Architecture tightly couples compute and storage resources, so a compute failure brings storage down as well. This forces the storage to undergo recovery, even if it's still usable. To overcome this, we will introduce NVMe-oF Recovery, a solution that ensures fast recovery by separating compute and storage failure domains within the CRUSH Map, while maintaining the reliability and scalability of traditional systems.

<p>
Data processing large amount of data on traditional storage comsumes large amount resources. Offloading computation to object storage provides several benefits to users. This session briefly intoduce typical data processing, what is Apache Arrow and how it can help users with Ceph.

   <td><strong>MicroCeph: Flexible Ceph Orchestration</strong>
<p>
Deploying and operating a Ceph cluster is complex because Ceph is designed to be a general-purpose storage solution. MicroCeph is an open source Ceph orchestration tool which makes it easy to deploy a Ceph on a single node and scale it to a highly available cluster as needed. This reduces the barrier of entry and makes Ceph more accessible to everyone but specially to the new users for training. For operations, MicroCeph makes configuration, scaling CRUSH, spawning services across cluster even easier. The intention of this talk would be to introduce MicroCeph to the viewers and promote the practices it employs for Ceph.

   <td><strong>On Deploying Ceph Clusters</strong>
<p>
Ceph is a distributed software-defined storage with scalability, delivering block, file and object in one unified system. It has been used in Cloud Stacks such as OpenStack and Kubernetes. We have been using Ceph clusters for VM image store, Kubernetes Persistent Volumes, NFS servers, iSCSI.

In this talk, we will present how to deploy a new version of a Ceph cluster in four different environments

- New deployment with Internet Connection
- Upgrade from an old version
- New deployment in an air-gapped environment
- Upgrade from an old version of a Ceph in an air-gapped environment

<p>
The object store provided by RGW has a weakness in that the object listing time increases depending on the number of objects. We share the results and analysis of the performance experiment conducted to prepare a countermeasure to this weakness. And we also share the derived tips for use.
