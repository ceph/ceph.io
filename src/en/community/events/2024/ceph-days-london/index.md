   <td><strong>We ran out of IOPSWe ran out of IOPS! Adding NVMe devices to an overworked S3 service</strong>
<p>
Our Ceph service was deployed with all HDD OSDs, intended for OpenStack Cinder volumes. We found radosgw/S3 was the use which really took off and we ran out of HDD IOPS performance in the rgw pools. Adding NVMe OSDs restored stability and sanity.
