## Ceph Developer Summit 2024

The Ceph Developer Summit, hosted at CERN in December 2024, will serve as a collaborative
gathering for Ceph developers to meet each other in person, engage in whiteboarding sessions,
and dive deep into technical discussions about the future of Ceph.

Space will be provided in the afternoon for experienced Ceph users to meet, collect ideas, and
brainstorm ways to improve Ceph. These ideas will be presented at the Users/Developers Birds of
a Feather (BoF) session during Cephalocon 2024, ensuring that user feedback directly influences
the project's evolution.
