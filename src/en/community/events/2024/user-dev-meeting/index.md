Join us for the Ceph User + Developer Monthly Meeting – a virtual platform that has long been in our community for encouraging
discussion and collaboration between users and developers. The overarching goal of these meetings is to elicit
feedback from the users, companies, and organizations who use Ceph in their production environments.

At this event, the results from a survey that was sent out to Ceph users of all experience levels will be discussed. The survey
covered performance and orchestration topics.
