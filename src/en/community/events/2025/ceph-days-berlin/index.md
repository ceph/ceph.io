This session emphasizes how integrating Ceph as an external storage backend provides the scalability and performance needed to meet modern demands—enabling your OpenStack deployments (via Cinder and Nova) to support high-performance applications.

Attendees will gain both a conceptual foundation and a practical understanding of this powerful combination. The session culminates in a live demonstration showcasing key steps for integrating external Ceph storage with OpenStack, provisioning high-throughput NVMe-oF volumes, and attaching them to VMs. Join us for this session to take your OpenStack cloud to a new level and turn it into a serious data-processing engine."

      <td>"cephfs-mirror today is largely single-threaded and, after a failover or restart, often rescans the entire remote tree. I’ll present two practical improvements:

1) Concurrent directory scanning + concurrent file transfer.
We use a bounded-frontier BFS↔DFS traversal where each directory is a task. When the global queue has capacity, we widen by enqueuing subdirectories (BFS); when it’s full, we dive (DFS) to keep making progress, continuously checking for newly freed queue slots to evenly distribute scan work across threads. In parallel, a second bounded queue feeds file-copy workers governed by in-flight byte limits. The result is adaptive parallelism, natural back-pressure, and predictable memory.

2) Snapshot-aware remote scanning on failover.
On restart or when a directory sync fails, the remote may be corrupted or only partially synced. In that case, we avoid a full remote rescan. We first reconcile against local snapshots to identify the matched tree and delta regions. Only the unmatched/delta parts are scanned and compared on the remote, and reconciliation runs only on those deltas. This shrinks recovery time and remote I/O while preserving correctness."
