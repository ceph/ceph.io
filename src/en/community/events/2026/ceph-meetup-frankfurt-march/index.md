### Hi Ceph Frankfurt Meetup Cephalopods!

Let's meet again - in the Frankfurt area!

</br>
<a class="button" href="https://www.meetup.com/ceph-frankfurt/events/313126236/">Register</a>


As always, it's about exchanging ideas about Ceph, what Ceph is, the latest developments in the community, and what you do or plan to do with Ceph. Please, check the themes list below for what you want to add - let me know or let's discuss it in the `discussions` or via `chat`. However, don't be shy - we all learn, although some of us may be more experienced, and those will be the source of your learning and experience.

We have a suggestion and volunteers for the actual themes this round (for now):

Ceph intro for newbies ( 17:50 - 18:40 ): This is *before* the main meetup.

What is Ceph - Ceph intro for newbies - watch out for additional invite, published separately
Main meetup ( 18:50-20:50 ):

planning of the next meetup dates through the year - perhaps also adding themes
changed layout on disks - how to wipe disks - (Matthias) - not sure we did it?
other - please suggest or volunteer!!!
anything else that's on your mind about Ceph
A little bit of housekeeping upfront:

There will be no recording. Presentations will be shared - if there are some, and if it's possible
drinks and food are up to the participant, so feel free to take your favorite drink and snack - we can arrange some beverage
If you have something to bring to the venue and share, some finger food is always welcome, but check the number of people that plan to attend in person
As we did before, perhaps plan for a beer/somethingElse (or two) as the "after-show" in the area around the location - any suggestions welcome!
Any changes required? Please suggest - even the time is open for discussion.

Somebody has room for us and wants to offer a location to meet - let us know, the `discussions` is the place to do this. Otherwise, if nobody else suggests a location, we'll meet at the Red Hat office in Frankfurt.

Any changes required? Anything we should do differently? Do you want to suggest a better time? Any thoughts and suggestions are welcome.

You need to bring your ID with you - it is required to enter the building!

We'll meet on March 12th 2026 in the lobby of the building between 18:40-18:50, so please be on time or give me a call on 0160-92654111 in case you're late.
Watch out for somebody with a red hat.

Please RSVP by Wednesday, March 11th, so we can determine how many people will join and prepare the registration.

AND: Please, send me your contact details so we can prepare access to the building:
- Full name
- your email address
- Company you work for

See you soon!
