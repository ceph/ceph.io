Google Summer of Code (g.co/gsoc) is Google's mentorship program for bringing
new contributors into open source communities. It's happening again for the
19th year in 2023! Over 18,000 developers from 112 countries have participated.

Google Summer of Code is a unique program where new contributors to open
source, ages 18 and over, are paired with a mentor to introduce them to the
open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open
source project over the summer. Projects cover a wide range of fields
including: Cloud, Operating Systems, Graphics, Medicine, Programming Languages,
Robotics, Science, Security and many more. GSoC Contributors do earn a stipend
to work on their medium (~175 hour) or large (~350 hour) projects. This is not
an internship but provides an invaluable experience and allows you to be part
of an amazing community!

GSoC is a highly competitive program, so don't wait to the last minute to
prepare! GSoC Contributors should reach out to the organizations that interest
them once orgs are announced on May 4, 2023. Potential GSoC Contributors can
apply at g.co/gsoc from March 20 - April 4, 2023.

See the list of projects we have available for GSoC contributors and [learn how
get started with contributions](https://ceph.io/en/developers/contribute/).

## Making Teuthology a Better Detective

**Mentor name(s):** Aishwarya Mathuria, Zack Cerza, Kamoltat Sirivadhna

**Mentor email(s):** amathuri@redhat.com, zcerza@redhat.com, ksirivad@redhat.com

**Project type:** 175 hour project

**Difficulty:** intermediate

**Skills needed:** Python, Linux as a development environment.

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** Teuthology

**Description of project:**
[Teuthology](https://github.com/ceph/teuthology/tree/master/docs), an automation test framework for Ceph, currently lacks the ability to detect and report certain unit-test failures
such as [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We want to improve teuthology's ability to recognize these failures and report them accurately so that it cuts down the time developers spent on
traversing through teuthology's logs, looking for the root cause of the failure.
The way we want to approach this is through parsing the xml file generated by the test frameworks,
since we believe that in doing this we only have to deal with 1 universal format rather than
many different failure patterns generated by different test frameworks.

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?**: Teuthology meeting

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

- Install teuthology (containerized testnodes) locally using the [docker-compose script](https://github.com/ceph/teuthology/tree/master/docs/docker-compose). Basically, install docker and run the start.sh script.
  - Screenshot all running containers with their names and status (e.g., command: docker container ls) and email it us (make sure to include all mentors).
- Write basic unit-test case using pytest in teuthology.
  - After installing teuthology, you should be able to run pytest, now we would like you to add a `test_raise_for_status.py` to <br />
    [teuthology/orchestra/test](https://github.com/ceph/teuthology/tree/master/teuthology/orchestra/test) where you exercise the function
    `_raise_for_status` in [teuthology/orchestra/run.py](https://github.com/ceph/teuthology/blob/master/teuthology/orchestra/run.py#L164). <br />
    The unit-test should test when `check_status` is `true`, `returncode` is `!= 0`, assert function raises `CommandFailedError`.
  - Open a pull request against `teuthology:master` branch with a branch that you created from your forked repo of teuthology. <br />
    If you are unsure on how to do this, you can read Ceph's development workflow [here](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/dev/developer_guide/basic-workflow/) and apply the same workflow to teuthology. <br />
    Please tag all mentors (kamoltat, zmc, amathuria) as reviewers once you have opened a pull request.

## All Clients Deserve a Chance

**Mentor name:** Yuval Lifshitz

**Mentor email:** ylifshit@redhat.com

**Project type:** 350 hour project

**Difficulty:** intermediate

**Skills needed:** golang, java, python

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** RGW

**Description of project:**

We have several examples of how to hack the standard AWS clients to use out extended bucket notifications APIs. Currently we have such examples for python (using the boto library) - however, we need to keep them up to date with the recent changes in our code we are missing an example of how to hack the golang/java AWS SDK for the same purpose.

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** RGW

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

- Build and run a vstart cluster
- Be able use the python boto3 SDK to upload an object to Ceph
- Be able use the Golang AWS SDK to upload an object to Ceph
- Be able use the Java AWS SDK to upload an object to Ceph

## Telescópio Lua

**Mentor name:** Yuval Lifshitz

**Mentor email:** ylifshit@redhat.com

**Project type:** 350 hour project

**Difficulty:** advance

**Skills needed:** C++, Lua

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** RGW

**Description:**
Enhance our Lua binding in the RGW to expose the content of an object when doing GET operations. The script should be able to process the object's content and overwrite it if needed. e.g.:

- Decrease image resolution based on client attributes, covert to black&white, or create thumbnails
- on-the-fly compression

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** RGW

## Visualizing a Ceph Cluster

**Mentor name:** Ernesto Puerta, Nizamudeen A

**Mentor email:** epuertat@redhat.com, nia@redhat.com

**Project type:** 350 hour project

**Difficulty:** intermediate

**Skills needed:**

- Python
- Angular/React/JS Frameworks
- Data Visualization (d3, plotly)

**Subcomponent of Ceph:** Dashboard

**Description of project:**

This project aims to provide users with a rich and interactive visualization of the status of a Ceph cluster. While Ceph already provides a high-level cluster status (HEALTH, WARNING, ERROR), that's often not enough when the cluster departs from the peaceful HEALTH zone to enter the shadowy WARNING or ERROR regions. In that situation, users will require a more fine-grained view of the status of the different cluster components.

[Reference](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/50980)

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** Dashboard

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

- Launch a containerized Ceph cluster (e.g.: rhcs-dashboard/ceph-dev)
- Access the Ceph Dashboard and the Landing Page
- Extend an existing chart to display a new performance metric

**What the first 2 weeks of work would look like during the internship:**

- Get familiar with the Ceph-Dashboard development environment and system architecture
- Understand how data flows from core Ceph to the Dashboard UI layer
- Identify the key data sources for depicting the status of a Ceph cluster
- Search Open Source charting and data visualization tools

## Improving Dashboard Accessibility for Blind and Visually-Impaired Ceph Users

**Mentor name:** Laura Flores, Ernesto Puerta

**Mentor email:** lflores@redhat.com, epuertat@redhat.com

**Project Type:** 175 hour project

**Skills needed:** HTML, JavaScript / TypeScript

**Difficulty:** beginner

**Subcomponent of Ceph**: Dashboard

**Description of project:**

The goal of this project is to improve Dashboard accessibility for blind and visually-impaired
users. While it's likely that the Dashboard already meets some accessibility guidelines, we
currently ignore its compliance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standard levels
(levels A, AA, and AAA). The steps to achieve at least an A level of conformance would involve using
a mix of web accessibility guidelines and software (listed in the Tracker) to evaluate the Dashboard's
level of accessibility and improve it as needed.
Reference: https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/43264

**Standup/weekly call mentee could attend?:** Dashboard, Core

**Steps to evaluate an applicant for the project:**

- Launch a containerized Ceph cluster (e.g.: rhcs-dashboard/ceph-dev)
- Access the Ceph Dashboard
- Run the Ceph Dashboard webpage through a web accessibility tool listed in the Tracker above and
  identify some areas that need improvement

**What the first 2 weeks of work would look like during the internship:**

- Deploy a containerized Ceph cluster
- Get familar with the Ceph-Dashboard development environment and system architecture
- Get familiar with web accessibility guidelines and tools
- Begin to identify areas of the code that do not meet level A accessibility guidelines
