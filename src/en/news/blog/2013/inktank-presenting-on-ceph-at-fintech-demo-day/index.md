It’s been [quite a year](http://www.inktank.com/culture/what-a-year-1/) for Inktank and the [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) community. We are super excited to announce another major milestone for Inktank – our participation in the third annual [FinTech Innovation Lab](http://www.fintechinnovationlab.com/) in New York City.

The goal of the Lab – established in 2010 by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City – is to enhance New York’s role as a leading hub for technology innovation, to spur job creation in New York, and to give entrepeneurs  an accelerated path to growing their business within financial services. We consider ourselves very fortunate to have been selected from over 100 applicants, along with Centripetal Networks, Dashlane, Narrative Science, OpenFin, and ScrollMotion, to participate in the FinTech Lab. Financial services firms that support the Lab include: American Express, Bank of America, Barclays, Capital One, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corporation, UBS, Ally Financial and New York Life. Supporting venture capital firms include Bain Capital Ventures, Contour Venture Partners, Rho Ventures, RRE Ventures and Warburg Pincus.

I will be presenting later today at the FinTech “Demo Day” at the Credit Suisse headquarters in Manhattan. The FinTech Demo Day gives Inktank a tremendous opportunity to showcase what we’ve been working on to the financial services sector in front of an audience of top press, analysts, investors, and a host of financial firms looking for ways to further their IT infrastructure strategies. Massively scalable, cost-effective storage is a big topic in the financial services industry right now, and we’re excited to showcase the benefits of the Ceph distributed storage system.

Leading up to today’s Demo Day, Inktank has benefited greatly from the 12-week FinTech program. We’ve been paired with six mentors who have provided guidance, expertise, and feedback that have already begun helping Inktank and Ceph’s growth into financial services. We’d like to publicly thank Bank of America, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, State Street and Contour Venture Partners (our VC mentor) for their insight and advice into customer requirements, product design, the financial services procurement process, and what to expect from the regulatory environment.

The program has been extremely worthwhile to Inktank, and will continue to be beneficial throughout our second year and beyond as we further momentum around signing customers, enabling partners, and certifying technology platforms. We fully expect to see growing adoption of Ceph in the financial services sector, along with related job creation in New York City.

But wait, there’s more…

To give banks and financial services an added incentive to see what Inktank and Ceph have to offer, we’re offering a [FinTech Ceph Subscription Voucher](http://www.inktank.com/fintech) that is good for a 90-day free trial of our [Pre-Production Subscription for Ceph](http://www.inktank.com/pps-form/), including three support tickets! This is a great way to get expert support setting up and configuring your Ceph environment

And while you’re here…

We’d like to invite our customers and partners to the next [Ceph Day](http://www.inktank.com/CEPHdays/), held at the Eventi Hotel in NYC on August 1st from 9am to 6pm. Customers, partners, and curious future Ceph-adopters are all welcome for a day featuring Ceph-creator Sage Weil, best practices for using Ceph, how to get started with the Ceph distributed storage system, and…a cocktail hour, of course.

We’ll keep you updated on Inktank and Ceph’s growth into financial services, but for now it’s time to demo!
