Come one, come all, to the world’s first (virtual) Ceph Developer Summit! Now that the Ceph project has moved to a regular release schedule we are trying to be more transparent about the [planning process](http://www.inktank.com/about-inktank/roadmap/). To that end, we would like to invite participation from any interested parties as the next release of Ceph (and beyond) is planned.

Starting today we will be accepting blueprint submissions via the [relaunched Ceph wiki](http://wiki.ceph.com). The timeline for submissions and announcements is as follows:

| Date       | Milestone                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 11 APR     | Summit announced, blueprint submissions begin |
| 29 APR     | Blueprint submission closed                   |
| 01 MAY     | Summit agenda announced                       |
| **07 MAY** | **Ceph Developer Summit**                     |
| 08 JUL     | Dumpling Feature Freeze                       |
| August     | Dumpling Release                              |

[Submit Blueprint](http://wiki.ceph.com/01Planning/02Blueprints)

### Call For Blueprints

The team at Inktank has submitted two blueprints so far: the [Ceph Management API](http://wiki.ceph.com/01Planning/02Blueprints/Dumpling/Ceph_management_API), and the [RGW Geo-replication](http://wiki.ceph.com/01Planning/02Blueprints/Dumpling/RGW_Geo-Replication_and_Disaster_Recovery) feature. But these blueprints are by no means an exhaustive list! We encourage users and community members to submit additional blueprints for general discussion and execution.

Interested developers should take a spin through the existing [Redmine backlogs](http://tracker.ceph.com) for each subproject and see if there are existing submissions worth picking up. Ultimately blueprint submissions should be an outline of work that a user intends to do (rather than a wishlist for Inktank). We welcome submission on any topic including:

- CRUSH rules
- RGW extensions
- Embedded object methods
- More robust ceph-deploy logic
- Increased OSD intelligence
- and many more!

Your blueprint should be an active document that will be maintained throughout the development process with the eventual goal of becoming the canonical guide on how the feature works. The sky is the limit here. If there is something you would like to see Ceph do, please document how you plan to build the feature as thoroughly as possible (even if you might need a bit of help to finish it) and submit it to our growing pile of blueprints on the Ceph wiki. Then come to the Ceph Developer Summit on May 6th and discuss the available designs with the Ceph developers and community.

### The Summit

Given how geographically disparate both our development team and the general Ceph community-at-large were, we decided it would be best to host this summit as a virtual event. This gives us the ability to include anyone with an internet connection and a webcam as well as the ability to easily record all sessions for later consumption by implementers, press, and anyone who just couldn’t make it.

The underlying purpose of the summit will be to discuss _how_ features should be implemented (rather than _which_ features should be implemented). Once blueprint submission closes, Sage will review all available documents and decide which are the most relevent features that need to be discussed. Simple stand-alone projects probably don’t need a discussion, but please still create the blueprint. Even if you don’t provide a blueprint in time, you can still land work in ‘Dumpling,’ so make sure to get that blueprint up!

Keep your eyes peeled for the connection details as the event gets closer. We’ll be sure to share them via the blog, X, facebook, google+, irc, mailing-list, and general word of mouth. In the meantime, if you have questions, comments, or anything for the good of the cause, feel free to hit up our [community team](mailto:community@inktank.com). Looking forward to your suggestions and your bright, smiling faces at the Developer Summit.
