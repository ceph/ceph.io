I’m excited to announce that this coming Thursday at 10am PST, I will be guest hosting a case study webinar with Inktank on [DreamHost’s](http://dreamhost.com/) cloud storage product, [DreamObjects](http://dreamhost.com/cloud/dreamobjects/). For those that don’t know me I’m the lead systems engineer for DreamObjects and have been working with [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) since 2010. We’re proud to be running a 2 petabyte Ceph cluster in production and I’m looking forward to giving an architectural overview and sharing the lessons we’ve learned as an early adopter of Ceph.

I’ll cover such topics as:

- Hardware and network configurations
- Management tools
- Ceph tuning and tips
- Lots more!

You can register for the webinar [here](http://www.inktank.com/news-events/webinars/).
