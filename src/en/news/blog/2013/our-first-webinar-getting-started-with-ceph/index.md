Yesterday was another milestone for our Inktank scrapbook. We hosted our first webinar titled “Getting Started with [Ceph](http://ceph.com/ceph-storage/)”. Our technical marketing engineer/overall nice guy [@klivansky](https://x.com/klivansky) presented the webinar, which lasted one hour and covered the basics of getting setup with Ceph.

He covered…

- An introduction into Ceph and Inktank
- A description of the Ceph architecture and key components
- The steps of setting up a virtualized Ceph cluster, which included:

- Creating a VirtualBox
- Preparing the VMs for creating the Ceph cluster
- Installing Ceph on all VMs from the client
- Configuring Ceph on all the server nodes and the client
- Experimenting with Ceph’s Virtual Block Device ([RBD](http://ceph.com/ceph-storage/block-storage/))
- Experimenting with the [Ceph distributed filesystem](http://ceph.com/ceph-storage/file-system/)
- Unmounting, stopping Ceph, and shuting down the VMs safely
