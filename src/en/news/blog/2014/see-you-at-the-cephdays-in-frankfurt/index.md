> A quick post to tell everybody that I'll be giving a presentation at the Ceph day in Frankfurt. Obviously, I'll be representing the company I work for, [eNovance](http://www.enovance.com/). The event is next Thursday, February 27, 2014. I am going to talk about Ceph, performance and benchmarking. You can check the details and schedule of the event [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ceph-day-frankfurt-tickets-10173269523). See you there!
