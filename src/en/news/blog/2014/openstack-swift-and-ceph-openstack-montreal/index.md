The second meetup of [Openstack Montreal](http://montrealopenstack.org/), in collaboration with [iWeb](http://blog.iweb.com/en/2014/03/register-openstack-montreal-2014/13258.html), [Enovance](https://www.enovance.com/) and [Savoir-faire Linux](https://www.savoirfairelinux.com/), will happen at the [Université du Québec à Montréal](http://www.uqam.ca/) (UQAM) monday march 17th.

It’s with great pleasure that I accepted an invitation from my colleague Rafael Rosa ([@rafaelrosafu](https://x.com/rafaelrosafu)) to talk about Ceph in the context of Openstack.

Our friends at Enovance will be talking about Swift, the object storage project in Openstack.

Should definitely be fun, it will in fact be my first public speech ever :D

Come join us, register - time is running short:
