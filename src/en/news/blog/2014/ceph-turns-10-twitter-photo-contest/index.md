OSCON has arrived (although if you came in for the [Ceph tutorial session](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34772) that's old news to you)! As a part of our participation in OSCON, and as a way to celebrate the fact that Ceph [turned 10](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/06/ceph-turns-10-a-look-back/) years old this year, we have decided to have our party be a distributed one.

We would love to have our users send us pictures of whatever they might be doing to celebrate the 10th anniversary of ceph. Are you busy racking in 3 petabytes of storage to add to your Ceph cluster? Did you create a culinary masterpiece in the form of a squid cake? Are you sitting alone in the middle of the OSCON show floor with a party hat and a cupcake? We want to see! As thanks for sharing your birthday celebration efforts with the community we'll be picking one lucky winner to receive a desktop Ceph test cluster built by our very own Mark Nelson (Ceph performance guru extraordinaire!).

While the cluster wont break any speed records, and only a madman would use it for anything even remotely production ready, it will give you a Ceph cluster to play with and can sit on your desk to invoke feelings of envy in your coworkers. For more details check out the (new) [contest page](https://wiki.ceph.com/Community/Contests) on the Ceph wiki. If you have any questions please contact me or just tweet @Ceph. Thanks, and happy birthday to Ceph!
