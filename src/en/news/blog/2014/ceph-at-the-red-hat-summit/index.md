Last week in San Francisco, we attended the [2014 Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit/). This event, in its tenth year, is a gathering of Red Hat customers and partners looking for information and best practices that help them build better infrastructure.

This show has been on our hit list for a while, but after the release of [Inktank Ceph Enterprise 1.1](http://www.inktank.com/partners/ceph-at-the-red-hat-summit/#), which included expanded support for the Red Hat ecosystem, it became a hotspot on our calendar! Our customers demand that Ceph work seamlessly alongside Red Hat’s products and services, and we partner with them to deliver a solid, integrated solution.

Recent download trends show increased demand for RPM packages, which now account for nearly half of all core package downloads. This chart shows downloads of the “ceph” RPM package and the “ceph-common” DEB package:

We were pleased to find out that Red Hat Summit attendees are fans of Ceph! Half of those participating in our Open Storage Survey indicated that they were using Ceph, evaluating it, or are planning to use it soon. An even larger number, 75%, expect to increase their investment in open source storage solutions. To see the full results of our survey, take a look at the [press release](http://www.inktank.com/news-events/new/red-hat-summit-survey-62-percent-using-open-source-storage-solutions/).

Another Inktank partner, Dell, also reported substantial Ceph interest in the financial industry. Sam Greenblatt, VP Architecture and Technology CTO, mentioned during his talk that [10 of 12 top Wall Street banks are asking to run Ceph](https://twitter.com/cote/status/456478984545390592).

All in all, this Red Hat Summit was a great event! We had a chance to talk with a lot of long-time users, as well as meet some new ones, and we were able to validate what we already suspected: many Red Hat users already love Ceph!

Until next time,  
Ross
