While we knew that after the acquisition of Inktank life would accelerate again, it seems like the Ceph community is quickly approaching ludicrous speed, and it shows no sign of slowing down. We have had some amazing participation in the various endeavors, but it would be completely understandable if you had missed something amidst the avalanche of Ceph-related news.

Just in case something flew by you, I wanted to take a few minutes to recap some of the highlights of recent history. If you would like to keep a closer eye on what has been going on feel free to follow one (or all!) of our informational feeds:

**24 JUL -- Sage wins Open Source Award** Those who attended OSCON most likely had the opportunity to see the winners of this year’s [O’Reilly Open Source Award](”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Reilly_Open_Source_Award#2014”) take the stage. Among the winners [was our own Sage Weil](”http://www.redhat.com/about/news/archive/2014/7/ceph-project-leader-sage-weil-recognized-for-decade-long-commitment-to-open-source”) for his tireless work over the last ten years of Ceph development. Sage was in good company as he shared the stage with Deb Nicholson of MediaGoblin and OpenHatch.org, John “Warthog9” Hawley of gitweb and kernel.org, Erin Petersen of Outercurve and Girl Develop It, and Patrick Volkerding of Slackware fame. This is great validation for a long commitment to Open Source. Congratulations again to Sage!

**21 JUL -- Twitter photo contest** If you hadn’t already seen the social media posts and mailing list messages, we are [giving away a desktop Ceph cluster!](”http://ceph.com/uncategorized/ceph-turns-10-X-photo-contest/”) Users that find some way to celebrate Ceph’s 10th birthday and submit photo evidence via Twitter including the hashtag #cephturns10 are entered to win a small desktop Ceph cluster, built by our own Mark Nelson, to play with. The contest is only open through the end of the month though, so hurry!

**20 JUL -- OSCON** The Ceph crew [descended on Portland again this year for both the](”http://ceph.com/uncategorized/celebrate-10-years-ceph-oscon/”) [Community Leadership Summit](”http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/”) and [OSCON](”http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014”). We enjoyed a multitude of cupcakes and great conversations. Hopefully you’ll join us again next year!

**16 JUL -- ICE 1.2** The Inktank Ceph Enterprise commercial offering got another rev with the [advent of v1.2](”http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/7/red-hat-adds-sophisticated-tiering-and-data-protection-features-to-its-industry-leading-storage-platform-for-openstack”), which added, among other things, cache tiering and erasure coding. There was a fair amount of buzz from the media, including a couple of [catchy titles](”http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/18/red_hap_ups_ceph_enterprises_game/”).

**02 JUL -- GSoC** We recently hit the [halfway mark](”http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/07/ceph-student-devs-hit-midterm-for-google-summer-of-code-2014/”) on our Google Summer of Code program. While Ceph only has two developers, they are both working diligently to contribute to the Ceph community, and we are very proud to have them. We can’t wait to see what happens next year!

**24 JUN -- 10th BDay** This year marks the [10th year of Ceph development](”http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/06/ceph-turns-10-a-look-back/”) (even though we have only been commercializing Ceph for the last two)! We have a number of efforts to help our community celebrate all of their hard work including a giveaway for a desktop Ceph cluster and the celebration in meatspace at OSCON. Happy birthday Ceph!

**24 JUN -- CDS G/H** This June’s [G/H Summit](<”https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/CDS/CDS_Giant_and_Hammer_(Jun_2014)”>) marked our fifth Ceph Developer Summit. Because of the delays of Firefly it ended up being an interim summit that recapped work already planned and discussed for Giant as well as some forward-looking plans for the Hammer release. Keep your eyes peeled for the next CDS as we get back on track for our quarterly release schedule!

**12 JUN -- OpenStack User Survey** The OpenStack community’s periodic user survey once again were very encouraging for fans of Ceph. The survey results showed that Ceph was the [leader across the board](”http://ceph.com/uncategorized/openstack-foundation-survey-cites-ceph-leading-distribution-block-storage/”) for block storage in clouds of all stages. We’re so very grateful for Ceph and OpenStack users everywhere for their continued support. We plan on working hard to continue advancing the state of the art with both Ceph and OpenStack!

**10 JUN -- Ceph Day Boston** The Ceph community helped to make yet another Ceph Day event a smashing success! The latest event, [in Boston](”http://www.inktank.com/cephdays/boston/”), was well attended and contained some awesome talks from Sage and community members of all different flavors. If you were unable to attend and would like to see the video recordings of the talks, they are [now available on YouTube](”https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrBUGiINAakPk_o1eAnIxsYIYyMLyOTWt”). We would like to thank the participants of Ceph Day Boston and look forward to seeing you at a future event, as each one is a completely unique event.

**05 JUN -- Talking Ceph + Calamari** Right after the acquisition I took a few minutes to chat with Joe “zonker” Brockmeier [about the Ceph community and making Calamari open](”http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/06/upstream-podcast-episode-8-patrick-mcgarry-talks-about-ceph-and-open-sourcing-calamari/”). If you like podcasts and/or listening to people flap their gums, this might be a good link for you.

**30 MAY -- Calamari Goes Open Source** One of the things that we were most excited about with the Inktank acquisition was the ability for us to [Open Source our Calamari Ceph dashboard](”http://ceph.com/community/ceph-calamari-goes-open-source/”). This happened quite quickly and we got some great immediate traction from other dashboard developers. If you like Ceph and want to help develop the GUI please jump right in!

## Conclusion

Wow! It certain has been a busy couple of months, and we don’t plan on slowing down. In the near future we already have some great plans solidifying including several Ceph Day events (London, NYC, Bay Area CA), meetups, the next CDS, some infrastructure updates, and much more. If you have any questions or would like to help participate in community happenings feel free to [contact me](”mailto:pmcgarry@inktank.com”). In the meantime, keep up the awesome work cephers!
