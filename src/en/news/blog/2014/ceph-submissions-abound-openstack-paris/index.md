Voting for submissions is well underway for the next OpenStack summit, and this one is shaping up to be another great place to talk about Ceph. Almost fifty talks are currently [available for voting](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/) on the OpenStack site! Ceph has been steadily gaining popularity in the OpenStack world, especially if you take a look at recent [user survey results](http://ceph.com/uncategorized/openstack-foundation-survey-cites-ceph-leading-distribution-block-storage/).

[Start Voting!](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/)

The even better part is there are only three Ceph talks that were submitted by the former Inktank crew, which means there are a ton of organic submissions available. If you are interested in taking a peek at the Inktank crew specifically, they can be found at the following URLs:

- [OpenStack Storage APIs and Ceph: Existing Architectures and Future Features](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/openstack-storage-apis-and-ceph-existing-architectures-and-future-features) -- Josh Durgin

- [Deployment Best Practices for OpenStack Software-Defined Storage in Ceph](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/deployment-best-practices-for-openstack-software-defined-storage-with-ceph) -- Neil Levine && Kyle Bader

- [What's New in Ceph](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/what-s-new-in-ceph) -- Ross Turk

And, as a bonus, I also submitted a more general panel to look at how community is faring in the OpenStack universe:

- [Observations on How OpenStack is Advancing the Art of Community](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/observations-on-how-openstack-is-advancing-the-art-of-community) -- Patrick McGarry

If you have a few moments I would encourage you to go vote for as many talks as possible. There aren't many shows that employ a mostly democratic process in talk selection. So, even if you aren't going to OpenStack it is important that you help tell the community which talks are important and which ones are less so.

Regardless of the outcome, we on the Ceph team are honored to have such an outpouring of participation. We really appreciate having such a great community to continue driving awareness and adoption of Ceph. We look forward to seeing you all in Paris!
