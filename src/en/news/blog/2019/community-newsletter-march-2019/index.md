If you would help us with completing the existing translations or adding new ones, please see [https://www.transifex.com/ceph/ceph-dashboard/dashboard/](https://www.transifex.com/ceph/ceph-dashboard/dashboard/) and get in touch with us if you need any guidance or help.

Thanks a lot to everyone who helped with the translations, particularly Kefu Chai (zh_CN), Danni Setiawan (id_ID), Jarosław Owsiewski and Elzbieta Dziomdziora (pl_PL) and Pavel Borecki (cs)!
