This is the first release candidate for Luminous, the next long term stable release.

Ceph Luminous will be the foundation for the next long-term stable release series. There have been major changes since Kraken (v11.2.z) and Jewel (v10.2.z)

# Major Changes from Kraken

- _General_:
    
    - Ceph now has a simple, built-in web-based dashboard for monitoring cluster status.
- _RADOS_:
    
    - _BlueStore_:
        - The new _BlueStore_ backend for _ceph-osd_ is now stable and the new default for newly created OSDs. BlueStore manages data stored by each OSD by directly managing the physical HDDs or SSDs without the use of an intervening file system like XFS. This provides greater performance and features.
        - BlueStore supports _full data and metadata checksums_ of all data stored by Ceph.
        - BlueStore supports inline compression using zlib, snappy, or LZ4. (Ceph also supports zstd for RGW compression but zstd is not recommended for BlueStore for performance reasons.)
    - _Erasure coded_ pools now have full support for _overwrites_, allowing them to be used with RBD and CephFS. [Read more about EC overwrites](../rados/operations/erasure-code/#erasure-coding-with-overwrites).
    - _ceph-mgr_:
        - There is a new daemon, _ceph-mgr_, which is a required part of any Ceph deployment. Although IO can continue when _ceph-mgr_ is down, metrics will not refresh and some metrics-related calls (e.g., ceph df) may block. We recommend deploying several instances of _ceph-mgr_ for reliability. See the notes on [\`Upgrading\`\_](#id1) below.
        - The _ceph-mgr_ daemon includes a REST-based management API. The API is still experimental and somewhat limited but will form the basis for API-based management of Ceph going forward.
    - The overall _scalability_ of the cluster has improved. We have successfully tested clusters with up to 10,000 OSDs.
    - Each OSD can now have a _device class_ associated with it (e.g., `hdd` or `ssd`), allowing CRUSH rules to trivially map data to a subset of devices in the system. Manually writing CRUSH rules or manual editing of the CRUSH is normally not required.
    - You can now _optimize CRUSH weights_ can now be optimized to maintain a _near-perfect distribution of data_ across OSDs.
    - There is also a new `upmap` exception mechanism that allows individual PGs to be moved around to achieve a _perfect distribution_ (this requires luminous clients).
    - Each OSD now adjusts its default configuration based on whether the backing device is an HDD or SSD. Manual tuning generally not required.
    - The prototype _mclock QoS queueing algorithm_ is now available.
    - There is now a _backoff_ mechanism that prevents OSDs from being overloaded by requests to objects or PGs that are not currently able to process IO.
    - There is a _simplified OSD replacement process_ that is more robust.
    - You can query the supported features and (apparent) releases of all connected daemons and clients with ceph features.
    - You can configure the oldest Ceph client version you wish to allow to connect to the cluster via ceph osd set-require-min-compat-client and Ceph will prevent you from enabling features that will break compatibility with those clients.
    - Several `sleep` settings, include osd\_recovery\_sleep, osd\_snap\_trim\_sleep, and osd\_scrub\_sleep have been reimplemented to work efficiently. (These are used in some cases to work around issues throttling background work.)
- _RGW_:
    
    - RGW _metadata search_ backed by ElasticSearch now supports end user requests service via RGW itself, and also supports custom metadata fields. A query language a set of RESTful APIs were created for users to be able to search objects by their metadata. New APIs that allow control of custom metadata fields were also added.
    - RGW now supports _dynamic bucket index sharding_. As the number of objects in a bucket grows, RGW will automatically reshard the bucket index in response. No user intervention or bucket size capacity planning is required.
    - RGW introduces _server side encryption_ of uploaded objects with three options for the management of encryption keys: automatic encryption (only recommended for test setups), customer provided keys similar to Amazon SSE-C specification, and through the use of an external key management service (Openstack Barbician) similar to Amazon SSE-KMS specification.
    - RGW now has preliminary AWS-like bucket policy API support. For now, policy is a means to express a range of new authorization concepts. In the future it will be the founation for additional auth capabilities such as STS and group policy.
    - RGW has consolidated the several metadata index pools via the use of rados namespaces.
- _RBD_:
    
    - RBD now has full, stable support for _erasure coded pools_ via the new \--data-pool option to rbd create.
    - RBD mirroring's rbd-mirror daemon is now highly available. We recommend deploying several instances of rbd-mirror for reliability.
    - The default 'rbd' pool is no longer created automatically during cluster creation. Additionally, the name of the default pool used by the rbd CLI when no pool is specified can be overridden via a new rbd default pool = <pool name> configuration option.
    - Initial support for deferred image deletion via new rbd trash CLI commands. Images, even ones actively in-use by clones, can be moved to the trash and deleted at a later time.
    - New pool-level rbd mirror pool promote and rbd mirror pool demote commands to batch promote/demote all mirrored images within a pool.
    - Mirroring now optionally supports a configurable replication delay via the rbd mirroring replay delay = <seconds> configuration option.
    - Improved discard handling when the object map feature is enabled.
    - rbd CLI import and copy commands now detect sparse and preserve sparse regions.
    - Snapshots will now include a creation timestamp
- _CephFS_:
    
    - _Multiple active MDS daemons_ is now considered stable. The number of active MDS servers may be adjusted up or down on an active CephFS file system.
    - CephFS _directory fragmentation_ is now stable and enabled by default on new filesystems. To enable it on existing filesystems use "ceph fs set <fs\_name> allow\_dirfrags". Large or very busy directories are sharded and (potentially) distributed across multiple MDS daemons automatically.
    - Directory subtrees can be explicitly pinned to specific MDS daemons in cases where the automatic load balancing is not desired or effective.
- _Miscellaneous_:
    
    - Release packages are now being built for _Debian Stretch_. The distributions we build for now includes:
        
        - CentOS 7 (x86\_64 and aarch64)
        - Debian 8 Jessie (x86\_64)
        - Debian 9 Stretch (x86\_64)
        - Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial (x86\_64 and aarch64)
        - Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty (x86\_64)Note that QA is limited to CentOS and Ubuntu (xenial and trusty).
    - _CLI changes_:
        
        - The ceph \-s or ceph status command has a fresh look.
        - ceph {osd,mds,mon} versions summarizes versions of running daemons.
        - ceph {osd,mds,mon} count-metadata <property> similarly tabulates any other daemon metadata visible via the ceph {osd,mds,mon} metadata commands.
        - ceph features summarizes features and releases of connected clients and daemons.
        - ceph osd require-osd-release <release> replaces the old require\_RELEASE\_osds flags.
        - ceph osd pg-upmap, ceph osd rm-pg-upmap, ceph osd pg-upmap-items, ceph osd rm-pg-upmap-items can explicitly manage `upmap` items
        - ceph osd getcrushmap returns a crush map version number on stderr, and ceph osd setcrushmap \[version\] will only inject an updated crush map if the version matches. This allows crush maps to be updated offline and then reinjected into the cluster without fear of clobbering racing changes (e.g., by newly added osds or changes by other administrators).
        - ceph osd create has been replaced by ceph osd new. This should be hidden from most users by user-facing tools like `ceph-disk`.
        - ceph osd destroy will mark an OSD destroyed and remove its cephx and lockbox keys. However, the OSD id and CRUSH map entry will remain in place, allowing the id to be reused by a replacement device with minimal data rebalancing.
        - ceph osd purge will remove all traces of an OSD from the cluster, including its cephx encryption keys, dm-crypt lockbox keys, OSD id, and crush map entry.
        - ceph osd ls-tree <name> will output a list of OSD ids under the given CRUSH name (like a host or rack name). This is useful for applying changes to entire subtrees. For example, ceph osd down \`ceph osd ls-tree rack1\`.
        - ceph osd {add,rm}-{noout,noin,nodown,noup} allow the `noout`, `nodown`, `noin`, and `noup` flags to be applied to specific OSDs.
        - ceph log last \[n\] will output the last _n_ lines of the cluster log.
        - ceph mgr dump will dump the MgrMap, including the currently active ceph-mgr daemon and any standbys.
        - ceph osd crush swap-bucket <src> <dest> will swap the contents of two CRUSH buckets in the hierarchy while preserving the buckets' ids. This allows an entire subtree of devices to be replaced (e.g., to replace an entire host of FileStore OSDs with newly-imaged BlueStore OSDs) without disrupting the distribution of data across neighboring devices.
        - ceph osd set-require-min-compat-client <release> configures the oldest client release the cluster is required to support. Other changes, like CRUSH tunables, will fail with an error if they would violate this setting. Changing this setting also fails if clients older than the specified release are currently connected to the cluster.
        - ceph config-key dump dumps config-key entries and their contents. (The exist ceph config-key ls only dumps the key names, not the values.)
        - ceph osd set-{full,nearfull,backfillfull}-ratio sets the cluster-wide ratio for various full thresholds (when the cluster refuses IO, when the cluster warns about being close to full, when an OSD will defer rebalancing a PG to itself, respectively).
        - ceph osd reweightn will specify the `reweight` values for multiple OSDs in a single command. This is equivalent to a series of ceph osd reweight commands.
        - ceph crush class {create,rm,ls} manage the new CRUSH _device class_ feature. ceph crush set-device-class <osd> <class> will set the clas for a particular device.
        - ceph mon feature list will list monitor features recorded in the MonMap. ceph mon feature set will set an optional feature (none of these exist yet).

# Major Changes from Jewel

- _RADOS_:
    - We now default to the AsyncMessenger (ms type = async) instead of the legacy SimpleMessenger. The most noticeable difference is that we now use a fixed sized thread pool for network connections (instead of two threads per socket with SimpleMessenger).
    - Some OSD failures are now detected almost immediately, whereas previously the heartbeat timeout (which defaults to 20 seconds) had to expire. This prevents IO from blocking for an extended period for failures where the host remains up but the ceph-osd process is no longer running.
    - The size of encoded OSDMaps has been reduced.
    - The OSDs now quiesce scrubbing when recovery or rebalancing is in progress.
- _RGW_:
    - RGW now supports the S3 multipart object copy-part API.
    - It is possible now to reshard an existing bucket offline. Offline bucket resharding currently requires that all IO (especially writes) to the specific bucket is quiesced. (For automatic online resharding, see the new feature in Luminous above.)
    - RGW now supports data compression for objects.
    - Civetweb version has been upgraded to 1.8
    - The Swift static website API is now supported (S3 support has been added previously).
    - S3 bucket lifecycle API has been added. Note that currently it only supports object expiration.
    - Support for custom search filters has been added to the LDAP auth implementation.
    - Support for NFS version 3 has been added to the RGW NFS gateway.
    - A Python binding has been created for librgw.
- _RBD_:
    - The rbd-mirror daemon now supports replicating dynamic image feature updates and image metadata key/value pairs from the primary image to the non-primary image.
    - The number of image snapshots can be optionally restricted to a configurable maximum.
    - The rbd Python API now supports asynchronous IO operations.
- _CephFS_:
    
    - - libcephfs function definitions have been changed to enable proper uid/gid control. The library version has been increased to reflect the interface change.
        - Standby replay MDS daemons now consume less memory on workloads doing deletions.
        - Scrub now repairs backtrace, and populates `damage ls` with discovered errors.
        - A new `pg_files` subcommand to `cephfs-data-scan` can identify files affected by a damaged or lost RADOS PG.
        - The false-positive "failing to respond to cache pressure" warnings have been fixed.
