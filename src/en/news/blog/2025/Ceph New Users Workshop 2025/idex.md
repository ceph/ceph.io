## Welcome to the Ceph New Users Workshop 2025
Join us for the **Ceph New Users Workshop**, a hands-on event designed to help you get started with Ceph in a friendly, supportive environment. After a successful turnout in Geneva, the Ceph Team is hosting another New Users Workshop to help the community jumpstart their Ceph journeys.
This workshop is **sponsored by the Ceph Ambassador Program** and is held in **partnership with Cephalocon 2025**. It is **exclusively open and free of charge to registered attendees** of the main conference. If you're attending Cephalocon in Vancouver this year, this is the perfect way to kick off the event!

## What to Expect
Just like last year’s popular session, this year’s workshop will focus on the **new user experience.** We’ll cover:
- The basics of Ceph: What it is and why it matters
- Key concepts and architecture
- Common use cases and deployment options
- A guided, hands-on introduction to installing a Ceph cluster

We aim to provide guidance for anyone using Ceph, whether as an IT professional, systems administrator, developer, or simply curious about Ceph. This workshop is a great way to start your journey.
