If you’ve ever been to a developers summit, technology user group meeting, or an online technology forum, you may have noticed that there’s a scarcity of women. We’ve noticed that too so we’re doing our part to support women in technology and to encourage them to get involved in the open source revolution. The Ada Initiative is a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing participation of women in open technology and culture. This week we’re matching individual donations to Ada so please donate today. For more information, you can read our interview with Valerie Aurora, founder of the Ada Initative: [https://adainitiative.org/2012/01/interview-with-ceph-first-ada-initiative-bronze-sponsor](https://adainitiative.org/2012/01/interview-with-ceph-first-ada-initiative-bronze-sponsor)
