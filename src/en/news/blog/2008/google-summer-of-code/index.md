We’re applying for the Google Summer of Code this year. [Some project ideas](http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki/index.php?title=GSoC08) are posted in the [wiki](http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki/), although of course it is by no means an exhaustive list. From what I’ve read, some of the most successful GSoC projects are proposed by the students. That said, there are lots of interesting projects on the list that could use some love.

**Update**: We weren’t accepted. I had no idea it was so competitive to be selected as a GSoC org! If we apply again next year, I’ll definitely spend more time on the all-important “ideas” page (more detailed descriptions of suggested project areas, references to additional information, skills required, level of difficulty, etc.).
