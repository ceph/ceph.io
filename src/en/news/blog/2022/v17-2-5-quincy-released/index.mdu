This is a hotfix release that addresses missing commits from 17.2.4 release

## Notable Changes

- Treating daemons as `<daemon_type>.x` caused a crash 
  in the Telemetry module since the current method does not cover a case
  where a daemon id is more complex, i.e. `<daemon_type>.x.y`.
  When we parse the daemon type and daemon id, we should
  split it into a maximum of two pieces rather than splitting
  it by every `.` character. Specifying `1` in the Python
  .split() function will limit the split to a maximum of two items.

- bea9f4b introduced a regression that makes the activate process
  take a very long time to complete.
  `_get_bluestore_info()` which calls `ceph-bluestore-tool` binary via
  subprocess is called in an exponential way while this is not needed.
