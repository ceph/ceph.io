# Ceph at SREcon22 Americas

We are happy to announce Ceph will be sponsoring [SREcon22 Americas](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22americas)! Come visit us at our booth for discussions, play with a [Ceph cluster on Raspberry PIs](https://ceph.io/en/news/blog/2022/install-ceph-in-a-raspberrypi-4-cluster/), and get a Pacific shirt before they are all gone!

## User + Developer Monthly Meetup

In October 2021, the [User + Dev Monthly Meetup](https://pad.ceph.com/p/ceph-user-dev-monthly-minutes) was started with the goal for Ceph users to interact with developers directly.

- Share their experience running Ceph clusters
- Provide feedback on Ceph versions they are using
- Ask questions and raise concerns on any matters related to Ceph
- Provide documentation feedback and suggest improvements

Topics such as design ideas or feature improvements will continue to be discussed in the [Ceph Development Monthly](https://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph/wiki/Planning) meeting.

Meetings occur on the third Thursday of the month, so join us for the following discussion on March 17th at 15:00 UTC.

## Meet the Ceph Ambassadors

The [Ceph Ambassadors](https://ceph.io/en/community/ambassadors/) are representatives of Ceph. Ambassadors help people understand Ceph and the ongoing work. Additionally, Ambassadors help grow the community and act as a liaison to other adjacent FLOSS projects. See the available Ambassadors in your region and consider reaching out for assistance with your next meet-up, blog post, CFP assistance, and more!
