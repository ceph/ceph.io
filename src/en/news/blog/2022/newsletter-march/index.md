## Ceph Quincy Release Canadidate v17.1.0 Is Now Available

This is the first release candidate for Quincy. The final release is slated for
the end of March.

This release has been through large-scale testing thanks to several
organizations, including Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, who allowed us to harden
cephadm and the ceph dashboard on their 4000-OSD cluster. Subsequent logical
scale testing went up to over 8000 OSDs in a cluster. One major improvement is
in quality of service - the mclock scheduler, providing quality of service for
ceph clients relative to background operations, is now the default. More
information on the scheduler can be found in the latest
[documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/configuration/mclock-config-ref/#mclock-profile-types).

You can see these improvements and more in the [release notes
preview](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/quincy/PendingReleaseNotes) and
help contribute to the [pull request](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45048).

## User + Developer Monthly Meetup

In October 2021, the [User + Dev Monthly
Meetup](https://pad.ceph.com/p/ceph-user-dev-monthly-minutes) was started with
the goal for Ceph users to interact with developers directly.

- Share their experience running Ceph clusters
- Provide feedback on Ceph versions they are using
- Ask questions and raise concerns on any matters related to Ceph
- Provide documentation feedback and suggest improvements

Topics such as design ideas or feature improvements will continue to be
discussed in the [Ceph Development
Monthly](https://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph/wiki/Planning) meeting.

Meetings occur on the third Thursday of the month, so join us for the following discussion on March 17th at 15:00 UTC.

## Meet the Ceph Ambassadors

The [Ceph Ambassadors](https://ceph.io/en/community/ambassadors/) are
representatives of Ceph. Ambassadors help people understand Ceph and the
ongoing work. Additionally, Ambassadors help grow the community and act as
a liaison to other adjacent FLOSS projects. See the available Ambassadors in
your region and consider reaching out for assistance with your next meet-up,
blog post, CFP assistance, and more!
