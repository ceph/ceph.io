## Publications About Ceph

Ceph began as research at the Storage Systems Research Centre at the University of California, Santa Cruz, funded by a grant from Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories.

Following the original publication on Ceph, the PhD thesis by Sage Weil, a variety of publications about scalable storage systems have been published.
