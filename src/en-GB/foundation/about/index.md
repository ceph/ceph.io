## Supporting the Future of Storage

**The Ceph Foundation supports and organizes the future of Ceph, independent of technical direction.**

The Ceph Foundation is made up of organizations, stakeholders, and industry leaders who collaborate and coordinate the investment, development, and community activities of Ceph. Under the Linux Foundation, The Ceph Foundation operates as a collaboration to maintain Ceph’s ecosystem, consolidate funds solely for the community and support Open Source processes.

Ceph stays true to its Open Source philosophy by leaving technical development in the hands of the global community. The technical direction of Ceph is handled by Ceph’s Leadership Team (CLT), which you can find out more about [here](../ceph-team/).

### Ceph Foundation Membership

Membership to the Ceph Foundation is tiered; Premier Membership, General Membership and Associate Membership. There are many benefits to belonging to The Ceph Foundation, shared across all tiers.

[See the benefits](../member-benefits/)

Premier and General Member organizations contribute a yearly fee, whereas Associate Members are educational institutions or government organizations invited to join at no cost.

Premier Members are guaranteed a seat on the Governing Board. One General Member is chosen to represent all General Members, and similarly one Associate Member is chosen to represent all Associate Members on the board.

### The Ceph Foundation Board

The Governing Board consists of various Foundation members who organize and distribute financial contributions for the improvement of the Ceph project, oversee community activities and developments, and collaborate to fulfil a variety of responsibilities. Foundations are a proven method to effectively collaborate and pool resources on large projects to encourage participation, spread responsibility and increase investment.

The Ceph Foundation Board is responsible for:

- Building and approving an annual budget for spending in support of the Ceph project.
- Establishing ad-hoc committees to address current needs of the project.
- Coordinating outreach or marketing.
- Meeting regularly to discuss Foundation activities, the status of the Ceph project, and overall project strategy.
- Voting on any decisions or matters before the board.

## Frequently asked questions

<details open>
  <summary>Q: Why did the community decide to start a foundation? Why is a foundation needed?</summary>

While Ceph is supported by an incredibly vibrant community of contributors, users and global companies around the world, the Ceph Foundation will organize and distribute financial contributions in a coordinated, vendor-neutral fashion. The foundation will also provide a forum for community stakeholders to coordinate their development and community activities on a regular basis. This will help galvanize more rapid adoption, training and in-person collaboration across the Ceph ecosystem.

As seen with countless other open source projects, providing a neutral home for the community to collaborate will encourage more participation and contribution. Foundations enable the community to spread responsibilities and costs for project infrastructure–helping to increase overall investment–while also providing more opportunities to get involved.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q: Why should developers care?</summary>

The foundation will provide more resources for Ceph development, which will benefit all contributors and those consuming or looking to consume Ceph. Some examples of support include organizing events and working groups to accelerate the pace of growth for Ceph, coordinating investments in additional hardware and cloud services infrastructure for CI and testing, formalizing governance structures, and providing marketing support to the project.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q: How will this impact the technical direction of Ceph?</summary>

The technical communities of Linux Foundation projects are independent, and Ceph will continue to develop according to its own road maps and timetables with input from the newly established Governing Board on project needs outside of the development process. The Linux Foundation accelerates the development of open source projects by providing the underlying assistance and governance that is necessary for collaborative work, including infrastructure and support for developers, events, marketing and community facilitation.

For more information, see the [Governance page](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/governance/) in the Ceph documentation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q: What is the difference between Premier, General, and Associate members?</summary>

Premier members pay more and are guaranteed a seat on the Governing Board. General members pay less, and one General member is chosen to represent all General members on the board. Associate members are educational or government institutions that are engaged with the Ceph community that are invited to participate in the Ceph Foundation at no cost. One Associate member is chosen to represent all Associate members on the board.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q: How is the Ceph Foundation organized?</summary>

The Ceph Foundation is organized as a directed fund under the Linux Foundation. That means that the Foundation is not a separate legal entity, and avoids the legal and managerial overhead associated with forming a truly independent organization. Instead, we take advantage of the Linux Foundation as an umbrella organization while keeping the Ceph Foundation finances in an independent fund for use in supporting the Ceph open source community.
